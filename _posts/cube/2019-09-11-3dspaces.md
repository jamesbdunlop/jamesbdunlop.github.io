For rigging, we need to setup controls that move various aspects of the rig.
Part of the rig live in all kinds of 3dSpaces and therefore we need to be able to 
construct and deconstruct these spaces effectively so the rig behaves correctly.

Some basic understanding of 3D space(in relation to objects in 3D space)
and how to manage them is very important.

Rotating around inside the 3D viewport you'll see the grid has a center 
point. This is the center of the universe, [0,0,0]. 

*Note: the further away we get from this the less accurate the [floating point]
calculations are etc.*

If you were to just make a pCube01 it'd be deemed to exist in 
worldSpace and if it's position is [0,0,0] it is deemed to be at the origin.

If you were to made a another pCube02 and parent pCube01 under it, 
pCube01 is now deemed to be inside the space of pCube02, it is local to pCube02.
Thus if you move pCube01 at anytime you're moving it relative(local) to 
pCube02's position, (which in turn is currently worldspace as it has no parent etc).

Does this mean you can't get to pCube01's worldSpace? No. You can still 
query pCube01 for it's worldSpace position via the 3D application's API/
nodeEditor tools etc, and when you query for this, the calculations will account
for all of pCube02's transformations as well *as the cumulative result of 
every transform(that affects pCube01) that's happened to get pCube01 to
where it is, is considered pCube01's worldSpace.*

##How do we handle these spaces?##
 
Well invariably behind the scenes there will be math ops dealing with matrices
/ vectors etc to calculate the results required and put an object where 
it should be; *and at some point you're going to need to understand this 
math if you want to get serious about controlling your rigs*, but to begin 
with, inside your chosen 3D application, and presented in a more 
accessible way.

*Interestingly in respect to the earlier comment about getting further away
from origin, we can use these spaces to tell the rig that we'd like to 
move everything all the way back to origin before doing any calculations
and then put it all back to where it should be. This can of manipulation of 
3d space can help reduce jittering / render issues when scenes are very large.*

*It is also more commonly known as localising a rig.*

So... approaches/tools that help us deal with spaces, **but not limited to**:

- **parenting** -(one object becomes the child of another thereby creating a heirachy)
- **direct connecting** -of attributes (that affect the position/orientation) 
 etc of one object to another
- **constraining** -one object to another (point, orient, scale etc)
- **deforming** -an object via a special 3D deformer (this will most likely 
 move the components of the object through a space rather than the base transforms.)
