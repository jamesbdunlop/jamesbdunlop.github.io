In this series I'm looking to introduce an artist with little to no understanding
of what is involved in creating a rig for a 3D asset, by showing these concepts
using just a polygon Cube.
 
*This should reduce the complexity/clutter of dealing with a full character setup
and allow us to focus on some of the fundamental concepts that get applied
across a myriad of 3D assets be they for Games / Film or TV.*
