For any Rig, the aim is to setup controls that Animators can move. These
controls... well ... control various aspects of the Rig, eye blinks, arms moving etc.

Since different parts of the rig live in different `3d Spaces` we need to be able to 
construct and deconstruct these spaces effectively so the Rig behaves correctly.

Some basic understanding of `3D space` (in relation to objects in 3D space)
and how to manage them is very important.

The first 3D space you will be introduced to will be in the viewport. And 
while rotating around inside the 3D viewport you'll usually be presented 
with a grid, and this grid has a center point. 

This is the **center of the universe**, [0x, 0y, 0z]. 

*Side note: the further away we get from this the less accurate the [floating point]
calculations are etc.*

If you were to make a pCube01 it's position will most likely default to 
[0x, 0y ,0z] and this is deemed to be at the `origin` of `worldSpace`.

It's in `worldSpace` because it has no parent, it's just sitting there
in the universe all on it's own controlled by nothing.

How ever; if you were to make a another cube (pCube02) and you `parent`
pCube01 under pCube02, pCube01 is now deemed to be, a child of, and inside 
the `space` of pCube02.

It is now considered `local` to pCube02.

If you move pCube01 around now you're moving it `relative(local)` to pCube02's
`space` in the world and the numbers you see might not reflect `worldSpace`
for the cube any more?!! This can be confusing, but just remember most applications
will now represent the position of pCube01 RELATIVE to pCube02 and not the `worldSpace`
because it is a child of pCube02!

Does this mean you can't get to pCube01's worldSpace? No. You can still 
query pCube01 for it's worldSpace position via the application's API/
`nodeEditor` etc; and when do you query for this `worldSpace` value, the 
application's calculations will account for all of pCube02's `transformations` 
as well *as the cumulative result of  every transform(that affects pCube01) 
that's happened to get pCube01 to where it is, is considered pCube01's worldSpace.*

How do WE handle these spaces?
------------------------------

Well invariably behind the scenes there will be math ops dealing with matrices
/ vectors etc to calculate the results required and put an object where 
it should be; *and at some point you're going to need to understand this 
math if you want to get serious about controlling your rigs*, but to begin 
with, inside your chosen 3D application, and are usually presented in a more 
accessible way (see the list below).

*Side note: Interestingly in respect to the earlier comment about getting further away
from origin and inaccuracies in the computers ability to caculate the math, 
we can use these spaces to tell the rig that we'd like to move everything
all the way back to `origin` before doing any calculations and then put it
all back to where it should be. This kind of manipulation of the rig's `3dSpaces`
can help reduce jittering / render issues when scenes are very large.*
*It is also more commonly known as `localising` a rig.*

So...anyway, approaches/tools that help us deal with spaces, **but not limited to**:

- **parenting** -(one object becomes the child of another thereby creating a heirachy)
- **direct connecting** -of attributes (that affect the position/orientation) 
 etc of one object to another
- **constraining** -one object to another (point, orient, scale etc)
- **deforming** -an object via a special 3D deformer (this will most likely
 move the components of the object through a space rather than the base transforms.)
- **math** - lower level nodes for matrix mathematics for direct manipulation of the transform space
