For quite a while a rig was mainly composed of joints skinned to the mesh, 
and some blendshapes. 

There wasn't a lot else thrown in on top. 

These 2 fundamental approaches haven't changed much in the last 20 years 
so I think it's important to at least understand what they are and how to handle them.

Joints are merely transforms describing a point in 3dSpace. Some applications 
treat these as special cases and make them strange first class citizens.

Skinning is the art of taking xNum of joints, assigning them to a mesh via
a skinCluster, and then `painting` each joint's *area of affect* onto the mesh.
The act of this `painting` literally establishes a `per joint' relationship 
to the vertexes on the mesh by assigning a weight value. eg:

vtx01: [joint01: .5, joint02:.5] means that 2 joints are assigned to vtx01, 
and each have a %50 weighting to the vertex.

*Note: You CAN assign these weights via a componentEditor and directly manage the list
of weights yourself, but as you can see below this can become a task that
even the mightiest of riggers would run screaming from.*

Thus we have paintWeight's tools to help make this a much easier job for us! 
But it's still pretty time consuming, and a very important part of deformation to get right!

<center><h2>My Style of Painting Weights for the last 20years</h2></center>

Years and years ago I started treating the whole process of weight painting as
the Bastard son of Satan! As a result, I ONLY WORK ON JOINT PAIRS and do not
have any faith/trust/respect for any kind of `auto' weight assignments 
while doing the work.

Essentially for the last 20 years (and to this day) my weight painting workflow is this;

- assign ONLY the joints required to deform the mesh to the skinCluster
- go through the ENTIRE set of joints and paint a %100 relationship for each joint
- work on normalized weights at all times (weights that will never exceed 1.0 in influence)
- use a TRUSTED smoothing algorithm to flood smooth a base smooth to ALL joints
- only ever work on PAIRS of joints and only ever ADD TO a joint never take away from it.
- prune (carefully so as not to destroy very soft weighting)

**Why?**

- If I assigned every joint under the sun I'm asking my DCC (Digital content creator)
to do a bunch of math that's **unnecessary!**
- I can CLEARLY dictate a `rigid' bind that will show exactly what joint 
is affecting which part of the mesh without having to manage smoothing etc
- I get to see the results of normalizing as I work
- I save time by having the computer do the BASE smoothing across ALL the joints
for me
- I am in control of which joint I am adding weights to and WHERE it is coming FROM
- I remove a ton of redundant small weight data. (making scene file save 
sizes smaller / less work on the cpu if weights remove a joint entirely from the calc)
 
If you do this, you'll be much more in control of your weight painting and 
you'll find it a whole lot less painful.

Here's a look at the process in action.

[Brave Rabbit brsmoothweights](http://www.braverabbit.com/brsmoothweights/) - Maya

This is a great tool for hitting an area of a mesh you want to smooth out
and get great trusted results from the smooth. I've used this a bit recently
and haven't suffered significant side effects. Reccommend this tool. Will
save you a lot of time. 

[ngSkinTools](https://www.ngskintools.com/) - Maya

The layering / masking / filtering in ngSkinTools just makes life a lot easier.
It's how the skinning tools should work really. The only down side here is 
for some pipelines you have to remove underlying nodes before submitting to farms
etc and that can result in the stack no longer existing in the scene when you
grab an asset from the server etc. But there are ways around that.. so...
