*"Inverse Kinematics is the inverse function/algorithm of Forward Kinematics. 
The Forward Kinematics function/algorithm takes a target position as the 
input, and calculates the pose required for the end effector to reach the
target position â€” the pose is the output."* - wikipedia

Inverse kinematics (IK) is used in rigged elements such as arms, legs, robot parts,
heck even car rigs can have IK setups in them.

If you take your hand and pick something up, did you rotated your humerus
first? then your radius/ulna next? then your wrist to get to what you were
picking up?

Sure they all rotated / moved... but you drove your hand out to the item 
you wanted to pick up. This is IK. You take a point at the end of the chain
and you can pull it around, and the IK math solves an effector to reach for
that point in space, rotates all the elements in the chain to the best 
possible positions to get that effector to that point in space.

Here's a look at that in Maya.

There are a few ways to approach this. But for now what you see above is
a joint chain that has an IK solver attached to it because Maya's native
solver attaches to joints. If you wrote your own IKChain solver you could
have the controls as inputs to your node and output the joints from the node
instead.

Regardless of HOW you're being forced to setup IK the concept of IK is 
essentially the same, and once you get a `handle' on it you'll be setting
up IK a lot (or using a tool to do it for you).

Maya has a few flavours of IK solvers;

- SingleChain solver
- RotatePlane solver 
- Spring solver

Each solver each behaving slightly differently (for you to research and play with.)
*There is also a splineIK approach that uses a curve(spline) to drive the joint chain.*

Here is our cube (with more subdivisions to show the deformation clearer)
being driven by a rotatePlane IK Solver in Maya (which makes it act more 
like a shoulder joint at the base, with an elbow break 1/2 way down).
