So these limited posts should give you a good scope to start playing with
om2.

(at the time of writing this I'm going to refer to some colleagues starting out with om2 and
add any posts necessary to help them understand some of the concepts to get
them up and running with the basics)

If you want to create a cmds.myCommandName you can refer to the
[MPxCommand post](https://jamesbdunlop.github.io/om2/2018/04/07/convertResetSkintoMPxCommand.html)

I will say this; after using om2 for a while now, AutoDesk are definitely
slacking a bit updating this code base. There are still things missing from
om1 to om2 that should have been updated by now, and there are some things you can do
in cmds that you just CAN NOT do with om2 (cmds.skinCluster, sculptTarget)
etc...

It is a great tool to add to your problem solving kit, so get stuck in and
start messing :)

Cheers

James!!
