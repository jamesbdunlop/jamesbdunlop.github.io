If you're keen read this now: <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2018/ENU/?guid=__files_Selecting_with_the_API_htm">Selecting_with_the_API 2018</a>

So I've selected all the default camera's in scene and want to access the
list of selected items in scene.

cmds:
{% highlight python %}
    from maya import cmds
    currentSelection = cmds.ls(sl=True)
    # Result: [u'persp', u'top', u'front', u'side']
{% endhighlight %}

om2:
{% highlight python %}
    from maya.api import OpenMaya as om2
    currentSelection = om2.MGlobal.getActiveSelectionList()
    # Result: <OpenMaya.MSelectionList object at 0x0000018AA59E5EB0> #
    
    # or you can create your OWN MSelectionList and add to it
    currentSelection = cmds.ls(sl=True, l=True)
    mSel = om2.MSelectionList()
    for eachNode in currentSelection:
        mSel.add(eachNode)
{% endhighlight %}

So the most noticeable difference here is;
* cmds.ls() returns a python list
* om2.MGlobal.getActiveSelectionList() returns an MSelectionList()

And since cmds returns a python list of strings you can very quickly use:

{% highlight python %}
    for myName in currentSelection:
        print(myName)
{% endhighlight python %}

But what the heck do you do with an <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2018/ENU/?guid=__py_ref_class_open_maya_1_1_m_selection_list_html">MSelectionList()</a>?  
We can't do this on the MSelection list?! Well we have to use the
MSelectionList.length() arg and iter using the .getDependNode() method. eg:

{% highlight python %}
    currentSelection = om2.MGlobal.getActiveSelectionList()
    for x in range(currentSelection.length()):
        myMObject = currentSelection.getDependNode(x) #-> MObject
        myMFn = om2.MFnDependencyNode(myMObject) # -> MFnDependencyNode function set
        print("{} is currently selected".format(myMFn.name()))

    >>persp is currently selected
    >>top is currently selected
    >>front is currently selected
    >>side is currently selected
    
    # Note you can also use getSelectionStrings on the MSelection list to get a tuple of
    # string names (though "but for non-contiguous components there will be a
    # separate string for each distinct block of contiguous elements"):
    currentSelection.getSelectionStrings()
    >> # Result: (u'persp', u'top', u'front', u'side') #
{% endhighlight %}

Since you've most likely just come from the [reading the API](2020-01-08-om2vscmds01.md)
post lets look at the docs for the getDependNode(x) method.

You can clearly see it says `Returns: MObject' so you now know what is being
returned by this method!

In the example above I used it to create an instance of the MFnDependencyNode
and print the name.

And this is now most likely starting to shine a light on the crux of the
differences for you between cmds and om2.

om2 is a little lower level. You're dealing more with python classes / function
sets now, and you're having to handle your MObjects, MPlugs etc so you have
to keep track of your types and what accepts/returns what.
