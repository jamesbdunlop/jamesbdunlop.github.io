<h2>PREFACE:</h2>
Over the last year in my spare time I've been doing some investigations in getting a couple of nodes worked
out at home.<br>
As it turned out, I haven't had a lot of spare time, as last year the show I was on was pretty challenging
time wise etc.
<br>So this year I thought I'd back track a little through my code and wth while I'm at it throw up a post or 2 about
what I've up to looking into getting these nodes running [for better or for worse!]<br>
<br>
DISCLAIMER: I'm still pretty new to c++ so I wouldn't rely too heavily on the code snippets etc. But the nodes are performing/
behaving pretty well at the moment for me.
<br><b>
I should also highlight that I had *NO* idea about hermite stuff before I worked with Raffaele
at Animal Logic.
<br>
If you're interested in rigging by first principles I highly reccomend you head over to <a href="http://www.cultofrig.com/">
Cult of Rig</a> and watch Raf's streams.
<br>
These are packed full of good info and you can flick him a few bucks via patreon to show support!

<h3>Why hermite?</h3>
Well you can do some pretty cool things with a well written node. Some of the things but not limited to;
<li> Running the hermite curve down the arms and legs for twist
<li> Length preservation along ropes etc
<li> General deformation in areas like the face etc

<br><br>
<h3>What was my initial goal?</h3>
<li> To investigate the creation of a node in Maya to take 2 inputs and ouput #n of output transforms(to drive joints) that
represent a hermite spline with twist to use in rigs.
<li> To try to make sure this can be run in parallel in Maya.
<li> Extend this node to handle and array of inputs to define the curve.

<br><br>
<h3>What were(are) my hurdles?</h3>
<li> Little to no C++ experience (In maya or out of)
<li> No idea about hermite math / math in general / curves!

<h2>What is a hermite?</h2>
First things first up I had to look into and try to figure out what the heck a hermite was from a math stand point!
<br><br>
Wikipedia states:<br>
<i>"In numerical analysis, Hermite interpolation, named after Charles Hermite, is a method of interpolating data
points as a polynomial function."</i>
<br><br>
But sweet baby jesus it gets confusing fairly quickly on wikipedia.
<br><br>
When looking further into this, I found <a href="http://www.cubic.org/docs/hermite.htm">cubic.org;</a> which states:
<br>
<i>"To calculate a hermite curve you need the following vectors:<br>
P1: the startpoint of the curve<br>
T1: the tangent (e.g. direction and speed) to how the curve leaves the startpoint<br>
P2: the endpoint of the curve<br>
T2: the tangent (e.g. direction and speed) to how the curves meets the endpoint<br>
<br>
...and the base functions for the hermite are:<br>
h1(t) =  2t^3 - 3t^2 + 1<br>
h2(t) = -2t^3 + 3t^2<br>
h3(t) =   t^3 - 2t^2 + t<br>
h4(t) =   t^3 -  t^2<br>
<b>Note: I changed s to t to represent (t)ime.<br></b>
These 4 vectors are simply multiplied with 4 hermite basis functions and added together."
</i>
<br><br>

Brilliant! Someone broke it down to some fairly straight forward (math) basics. Much <3!!
<br>
Essentially, because to begin with I have reduced the problem down to just 2 input points we can start at point1's position in
worldSpace and end at point2's position in world space. Thus t0 = p1 and t1 = p2.
<br><br>
So what does this mean for the node?
<br>
At it's most basic form, we need to create a node in maya with just 2 inputs...
<li>get their positions (p1, p2)
<li>and 2 tangents T1, T2 [and for simplicity use a specific axis from each point as these tangents].
<li> since length is going to be 1 we can work out the increment (time intervals
for the outputs) by dividing the length by the number of outputs minus 1.
<br> increment = length / outputCount-1.
<br>
<br>
This should give us a 2point hermite curve with a UNIFORM distribution of the outputs along the curve.
<br>
Seems easy enough!? Right?
