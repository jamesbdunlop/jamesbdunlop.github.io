<h2>Basic node jbd_hermite: .h</h2>
So first up I needed to get a shell of the node organised. Designing the interface for the node is as
good a place as any.
<br>
So I'm going to need (as per part01 of this `thread');
<li> 2 points, and their tangents
<li> #n of outputs
<li> assumed length of 1
<br><br>
So a basic header ended up looking like this;<br>

{% highlight c++ %}
class jbd_hermite:public MPxNode{
public:
    <SNIP>
    //- Attrs
    static MObject inPuts;
    static MObject inMatrix;
    static MObject inTangentWeight;

    static MObject outputCount;

    static MObject outPuts;
    static MObject outMatrix;
    static MObject outScale;
    static MObject outTranslate;
    static MObject outRotate;
        static MObject outRotateX;
        static MObject outRotateY;
        static MObject outRotateZ;
};
{% endhighlight %}

Now the quirky part here on initial inspection is that I chose to go with inPuts instead of p0 and p1.
I did this because I want to extend this to be a hermiteArray later on accepting #n of input points, but for now
I will only pull index 0 and 1 from the array for this node.
<br>
So inPuts will be an array with each element in the array consisting of;
<li> inMatrix
<li> inTangentWeight [The multiplier of the tangent]</li>
<br>
And outputs will become an array of outputs with each element in the array consisting of;
<ul>
<li> outMatrix </li>
<li> outTranslate [as a nAttr.createPoint with x y z] </li>
<li> outRotate </li>
    <ul>
    <li> outRotateX </li>
    <li> outRotateY </li>
    <li> outRotateZ </li>
    </ul>
<li> outScale [as a nAttr.createPoint with x y z]</li>
</ul>

Later on I added the inverseParent, baseLength and normalizeTangents as per the png above, mainly because I wanted to be
able to just normalize the tangents to a length of 1 with a click, make sure the node was always localized to the rig and
perhaps at some point set it to be only along the curve to a time value of .5 instead of 1.
<br><br>


<h2>Basic node utils: .cpp</h2>
So here's where it got interesting, [and where my lack of c++ experience gets a bright light shined on it] in my spare time. The problems
I faced here was how to handle all the code in the compute cleanly so my brain didn't explode!
<br>
Essentially I ended up building a utils.cpp with the following;
<br>
{% highlight c++ %}
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// HERMITE STUFF
// CUBIC HERMITE BASIS FUNCTIONS
// h1
inline float cubicH1(float t){return ( 2.0f*pow(t, 3) - 3.0f*pow(t, 2) ) + 1.0f;}
// h2
inline float cubicH2(float t){return ( -2.0f*pow(t, 3) + 3.0f * pow(t, 2) );}
// h3
inline float cubicH3(float t){return (pow(t, 3) - (2.0f*pow(t, 2) )) + t;}
// h4
inline float cubicH4(float t){return pow(t, 3) - pow(t, 2);}
{% endhighlight %}
This helped me reduce the code for the hermite equations into inline calls which to me at the time made more sense.
<br>
From there I built a function to use these from the compute.
{% highlight c++ %}
MFloatVector getUnitHermiteVector(float t, MFloatMatrix p1, MFloatMatrix p2, MFloatVector p1t, MFloatVector p2t){
    float x = (cubicH1(t)*p1(3,0)) + (cubicH3(t)*p1t.x) + (cubicH2(t)*p2(3,0)) + (cubicH4(t)*p2t.x);
    float y = (cubicH1(t)*p1(3,1)) + (cubicH3(t)*p1t.y) + (cubicH2(t)*p2(3,1)) + (cubicH4(t)*p2t.y);
    float z = (cubicH1(t)*p1(3,2)) + (cubicH3(t)*p1t.z) + (cubicH2(t)*p2(3,2)) + (cubicH4(t)*p2t.z);
    MFloatVector result(x, y, z);
    return result;
}
{% endhighlight %}
Remember back in post 1 "These 4 vectors are simply multiplied with 4 hermite basis functions and added together."
That essentially is what I am using this function for.
<br><br>
p1(3,0) is point1's tx from the matrix, and p1(3,1) is point 1's ty from the matrix etc
<br>
p2(3,0) is point 2's tx  from the matrix, and p2(3,1) is point 2's ty  from the matrix etc
<br><br>
I also made the decision to go along with vectors over a matrix math approach because well gotta start somewhere right?
<br>
<br>
<h2>Basic node jbd_hermite::compute: .cpp</h2>
I'm going to ignore the whole node initialization of the node as this isn't really that kind of post, and skip straight to the compute.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<center><b>*NOTE: The below snippets of code cover the translate aspect of the node only.*</b></center>

{% highlight c++ %}
MStatus jbd_hermite::compute( const MPlug& plug, MDataBlock& dataBlock ){
    struct Knot{
        MFloatMatrix mtx;
        MFloatMatrix localMtx;
        MFloatVector XTangent;
        MFloatVector YTangent;
        MFloatVector ZTangent;
        MFloatVector hermitePoint;
    }point1, point2;

{% endhighlight %}
Here I created a struct for storing the point data for use in the later iterator.
<br>
Note: This is more a descision for sanity and keeping my code it clean later on, and tbh I'm not entirely
across the impact performance wise if this is a bad idea or not but my brain hurt less because of it. At the moment
it makes sense to avoid having to jump through the array index 0 and 1 each time I loop through the outputs, instead
just pulling the data directly from the previously formed struct data. Should be faster??
<br><br><br><hr>

{% highlight c++ %}
    MStatus status = MS::kUnknownParameter;
    if (plug == outPuts || plug.parent() == outPuts){
        MArrayDataHandle inputsArrayHndl = dataBlock.inputArrayValue(inPuts);
        int cvCount = inputsArrayHndl.elementCount();
        if (cvCount < 2){
            status = MS::kSuccess;
        }
{% endhighlight %}
Here we want to exit early if we don't have a cv count of 2. If we have a cv count of more than 2 at this point I don't care cause I'm
only pull index 0 and 1 from the array and everything else is ignored.
<br><br><br><hr>

{% highlight c++ %}
        else{
            MDataHandle inOuputCount = dataBlock.inputValue(outputCount);
            int outCount = inOuputCount.asInt();
            MArrayDataHandle outputArray = dataBlock.outputArrayValue(outPuts);
            MArrayDataBuilder builder = outputArray.builder();

            inputsArrayHndl.jumpToElement(0);
            /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
            // POINT ONE
            point1.mtx = inputsArrayHndl.inputValue().child(inMatrix).asFloatMatrix();
            point1.XTangent.x = point1.localMtx[0][0];
            point1.XTangent.y = point1.localMtx[0][1];
            point1.XTangent.z = point1.localMtx[0][2];
            point1.XTangent *= inputsArrayHndl.inputValue().child(inTangentWeight).asFloat();

            /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
            // POINT TWO
            inputsArrayHndl.jumpToArrayElement(1);
            point2.mtx = inputsArrayHndl.inputValue().child(inMatrix).asFloatMatrix();
            point2.XTangent.x = point2.localMtx[0][0];
            point2.XTangent.y = point2.localMtx[0][1];
            point2.XTangent.z = point2.localMtx[0][2];
            point2.XTangent *= inputsArrayHndl.inputValue().child(inTangentWeight).asFloat();

{% endhighlight %}
Here I'm leveraging the struct and pushing the data I want to call later on in the iterator as I go through all the outputs.
<br>
Note: I'm using the XTangent of the matrix as the hermite tangent!
<br>
This does create a need for rigging to mind map the axis correctly when setting up a rig with the node, but it's
not too hard for them to remember.
<br><br><br><hr>
{% highlight c++ %}
            /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
            // CALC HERMITE NOW
            int outPort = 0;
            float increment = 1.0f / float(outCount-1);
            float x = 0.0f;
            if(outCount >= 2){
                for(unsigned int i=0; i<=outCount-1; i++){
                    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
                    // TRANSLATION
                    MDataHandle out = builder.addElement(outPort);
                    MDataHandle oTranslateH = out.child(outTranslate);
                    MDataHandle oRotateH = out.child(outRotate);
                    MDataHandle oScaleH = out.child(outScale);

                    MFloatVector hermiteVector = getUnitHermiteVector(x, point1.localMtx, point2.localMtx, point1.XTangent, point2.XTangent);
                    MFloatMatrix hermiteMtx = MFloatVector_to_MFloatMatrix(hermiteVector);
                    oTranslateH.set(MFloatMatrix_to_MFloatVector(hermiteMtx));
                    oTranslateH.setClean();
                    
                    outPort += 1;
                    x += increment;
                }
            }
            status = MS::kSuccess;
        }
    }
    return status;
}
{% endhighlight %}

So we iter through the outputCount -1 because we start at 0 which counts as an output, and we use the increment
to step along the curve uniformly for the #outputs we want to distribute along the curve.
<br><hr>
<h2>Final Notes:</h2>
Consider:
<br>
10 outputs distributed along a curve of len 10.0f. The increment becomes 10.0f/9.0f = 1.111
{% highlight c++ %}
for(unsigned int i=0;
{% endhighlight %}
The iterator already starts at 0 which counts as one output, so we need to finish the iterator at outCount-1 or we
end up with one output more than we need.
<br>
And that's it! Now we have the foundation for a hermite curve setup in maya. The interesting part here being that
you can daisy chain this node and the curve will extend seamlessly;
<br>
eg:<br>
<center><img src="/assets/examples/2pnChain.png" alt="2pntHermiteChained"></center>
<br>
Now obviously for more complex rigs daisy chaining tons of nodes can be a pita, which is the reason I went with the
array for the inputs so I could extend this node to accept #n of inputs to work out the hermite along in a single node.
<br>
Note: In the image above, because I am using the worldMatrix[0] from the locators I later put into the node the
inverseParentSpace so I can localize the calculations to avoid any floating point precision issues when rigs are animated
far away from origin (0,0,0)

And this is a look at the node working with rotation and scale for the tangents... pretty cool!<br>
Profiling the node on that scene (total of 44 ouputs to drive the joints):<br>
