<h2>Basic node jbd_hermite: .h</h2>
So first up I needed to get a shell of the node organised. Designing the interface for the node is as
good a place as any.
<br>
So I'm going to need (as per part01 of this `thread');
<li> 2 points, and their tangents
<li> #n of outputs
<li> assumed length of 1
<br><br>
So a basic header ended up looking like this;<br>

{% gist 8079f868ca1b23ef138b6c8f9665c2c7 %}

Now the quirky part here on initial inspection is that I chose to go with inPuts instead of p0 and p1.
I did this because I want to extend this to be a hermiteArray later on accepting #n of input points, but for now
I will only pull index 0 and 1 from the array for this node.
<br>
So inPuts will be an array with each element in the array consisting of;
<li> inMatrix
<li> inTangentWeight [The multiplier of the tangent]</li>
<br>
And outputs will become an array of outputs with each element in the array consisting of;
<ul>
<li> outMatrix </li>
<li> outTranslate [as a nAttr.createPoint with x y z] </li>
<li> outRotate </li>
    <ul>
    <li> outRotateX </li>
    <li> outRotateY </li>
    <li> outRotateZ </li>
    </ul>
<li> outScale [as a nAttr.createPoint with x y z]</li>
</ul>

Later on I added the inverseParent, baseLength and normalizeTangents as per the png above, mainly because I wanted to be
able to just normalize the tangents to a length of 1 with a click, make sure the node was always localized to the rig and
perhaps at some point set it to be only along the curve to a time value of .5 instead of 1.
<br><br>


<h2>Basic node utils: .cpp</h2>
So here's where it got interesting, [and where my lack of c++ experience gets a bright light shined on it] in my spare time. The problems
I faced here was how to handle all the code in the compute cleanly so my brain didn't explode!
<br>
Essentially I ended up building a utils.cpp with the following;
<br>
{% gist 653e26665053250e427fd61a44816a35 %}

This helped me reduce the code for the hermite equations into inline calls which to me at the time made more sense.
<br>
From there I built a function to use these from the compute.
{% gist 432db2b955b7d40c0eaf159c4dcac072 %}

Remember back in post 1 "These 4 vectors are simply multiplied with 4 hermite basis functions and added together."
That essentially is what I am using this function for.
<br><br>
p1(3,0) is point1's tx from the matrix, and p1(3,1) is point 1's ty from the matrix etc
<br>
p2(3,0) is point 2's tx  from the matrix, and p2(3,1) is point 2's ty  from the matrix etc
<br><br>
I also made the decision to go along with vectors over a matrix math approach because well gotta start somewhere right?
<br>
<br>
<h2>Basic node jbd_hermite::compute: .cpp</h2>
I'm going to ignore the whole node initialization of the node as this isn't really that kind of post, and skip straight to the compute.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<center><b>*NOTE: The below snippets of code cover the translate aspect of the node only.*</b></center>

{% gist 9ba0dd1f018d6e1bde5e92aa9d9c4753 %}

Here I created a struct for storing the point data for use in the later iterator.
<br>
Note: This is more a descision for sanity and keeping my code it clean later on, and tbh I'm not entirely
across the impact performance wise if this is a bad idea or not but my brain hurt less because of it. At the moment
it makes sense to avoid having to jump through the array index 0 and 1 each time I loop through the outputs, instead
just pulling the data directly from the previously formed struct data. Should be faster??
<br><br><br><hr>

{% gist c043a2c186704847aeafef12b8b75ead %}

Here we want to exit early if we don't have a cv count of 2. If we have a cv count of more than 2 at this point I don't care cause I'm
only pull index 0 and 1 from the array and everything else is ignored.
<br><br><br><hr>

{% gist 043242ee9b530987b756138124dc0858 %}

Here I'm leveraging the struct and pushing the data I want to call later on in the iterator as I go through all the outputs.
<br>
Note: I'm using the XTangent of the matrix as the hermite tangent!
<br>
This does create a need for rigging to mind map the axis correctly when setting up a rig with the node, but it's
not too hard for them to remember.
<br><br><br><hr>
{% gist a67bb36c62fd185ab8a55ec30dfdd2c0 %}


So we iter through the outputCount -1 because we start at 0 which counts as an output, and we use the increment
to step along the curve uniformly for the #outputs we want to distribute along the curve.
<br><hr>
<h2>Final Notes:</h2>
Consider:
<br>
10 outputs distributed along a curve of len 10.0f. The increment becomes 10.0f/9.0f = 1.111
{% highlight c++ %}
for(unsigned int i=0;
{% endhighlight %}
The iterator already starts at 0 which counts as one output, so we need to finish the iterator at outCount-1 or we
end up with one output more than we need.
<br>
And that's it! Now we have the foundation for a hermite curve setup in maya. The interesting part here being that
you can daisy chain this node and the curve will extend seamlessly;
<br>
eg:<br>
<center><img src="/assets/examples/2pnChain.png" alt="2pntHermiteChained"></center>
<br>
Now obviously for more complex rigs daisy chaining tons of nodes can be a pita, which is the reason I went with the
array for the inputs so I could extend this node to accept #n of inputs to work out the hermite along in a single node.
<br>
Note: In the image above, because I am using the worldMatrix[0] from the locators I later put into the node the
inverseParentSpace so I can localize the calculations to avoid any floating point precision issues when rigs are animated
far away from origin (0,0,0)

And this is a look at the node working with rotation and scale for the tangents... pretty cool!<br>
Profiling the node on that scene (total of 44 ouputs to drive the joints):<br>
DG: 150fps<br>
Serial: 312.5fps<br>
Parallel: 365.9fps<br></center>
