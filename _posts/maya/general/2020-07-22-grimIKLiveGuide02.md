So sure, it's all well and good to hook just the FK to follow the guide and consider it a live guide. But we have a bunch
of other things we can consider for the fit to make life easier for someone else coming in to fit the rig to an asset.

Since the grimIK caters for characters lets stick to using character terms here;

- The knee position.
- A reset pose (if you're working in a bindPose and want to zero out the controls to a TPose)
- Scaling considerations.
- Mirroring considerations.


Here we're going to focus on how to do the knee position by adding a knee guide and working out how that relates to the
2 limb lengths via some simple vector math.

WIP still to do :) coming soon...
