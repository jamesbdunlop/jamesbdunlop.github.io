So stumbled on something interesting tonight. Figured I'd post about it.
<a href="https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2018/ENU/?guid=GUID-834BD274-8A3C-4CCB-81EC-0D2A599CA108">Create custom marking menus in the Node Editor</a>

Cool!
So I tried this out immediately;

Now I wouldn't approach this like this. I'm going to look at a way to get this cleaned up and see about adding some
of these to my node editor, cause it definitely frustrates me having to go for buttons all the time when prototyping
rigs.

At some point I'm going to have rounded up a script to cleanup the entire nodeEditor to how I like it, filters, menus etc.
