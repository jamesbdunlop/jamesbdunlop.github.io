K this has been a bit of an experiment.

Previously I was using a mix of om1 and om2 as per Hamish Mackenzies post here: http://www.macaronikazoo.com/?p=417

So this time around I wanted to gun for nothing but om2. Which mean't taking a somewhat non standard approach.

It appears to be working, have tested this on various skins, and while comments are not on the ghpages static sites I'd love to hear how this is working for any one brave enough to test it.

Should be okay to throw it into the wild. I've condensed all the required functions from my lib into
this post so everything should work directly from the below functions [thus avoiding the lib].

Note: If you do copy paste from below, depenency will be simplejson!!
