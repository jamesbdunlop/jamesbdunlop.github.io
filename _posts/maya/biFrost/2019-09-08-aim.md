So I decided to look into biFrost and see what the noodling is like.
Here's a little aim network test I put together.

So this takes the worldMtx[0] as an input for both the aimed and aimedTo
and outputs a matrix(that I have decomposed to SRT [ scare rotate translate] )

I have to say that it was a bit frustrating to do the vec sub as I had to create
a compound to do the subtraction, and trying to create regular mtx2SRT output that I can
connect to a maya node (with angular rotation inputs) was some kind of voodoo magic I , 
could not work out. But other than that it was relatively painless!

This is crossing the X and a unitZ vector to give the upVector. Could look to extend this later for a 
use specified up vector etc etc.
