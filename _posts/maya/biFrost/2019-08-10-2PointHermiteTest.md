Mock up of the c++ hermite I was playing with but as a biFrost network. 

This is positions only cause ... well fuck rotation :P

*I may add it later but just exploring atm.*

9mg Gif sorry :P 

I won't put the link to this network cause it's incomplete. 

Because of the nature of the piecewise polynomials I can daisy chain these 
and get a continuous curve.
