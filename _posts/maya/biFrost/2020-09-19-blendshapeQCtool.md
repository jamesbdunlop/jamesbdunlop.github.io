More bifrost messing!

This time looking into using the network to output a shape of all connected blendshapes to show the moved verts clearly
so it's easy to spot stray undesired weights.

Super straight forward. Just color moved verts based on a tolerance.
We've found this kind of thing pretty helpful on previous gigs.
